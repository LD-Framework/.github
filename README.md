`shlifedev` framework.

This is a mirrored repository of all my personal source code hosted on git.shlife.dev. Most of it is either my own work or open source under the MIT license.

So anyone can access this repository.
However, if it contains paid assets or commercial source code, the repository is treated as private and may not be accessible as a dependency.
